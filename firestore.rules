/**
 * PlantãoAI Security Rules
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a strict user-ownership model. The security posture is built on the principle 
 * of "Path-Based Authorization," where access to data is granted based on the user's presence in the 
 * document path itself.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is organized hierarchically under a root /users/{userId} collection. 
 * Specifically, IT support tickets (Chamados) are stored at /users/{userId}/chamados/{chamadoId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * 1. Ownership Enforcement: Every read and write operation is scoped to the authenticated user's UID. 
 *    Cross-user data access is strictly forbidden at the database level.
 * 2. Authorization Independence: By nesting Chamados under the user document, we eliminate the need 
 *    for costly `get()` lookups. The path itself provides the necessary context for authorization.
 * 3. Prototyping Flexibility: While ownership is strictly enforced, the schema of the data (fields 
 *    like 'titulo', 'status', etc.) is not validated here to allow for rapid development iterations. 
 *    Only relational fields (like IDs) are validated for consistency.
 * 4. Denial by Default: Any path not explicitly defined in these rules is inaccessible.
