    /**
     * SECURITY RULES DOCUMENTATION
     * 
     * Core Philosophy: 
     * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. The security posture is built 
     * around "Authorization Independence," where access is determined primarily by the 
     * document's location within the path hierarchy, avoiding expensive cross-document lookups.
     * 
     * Data Structure: 
     * All application data is organized hierarchically under the user's primary document:
     * /users/{userId}/demands/{demandId}
     * 
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * 1. Path-Based Ownership: The {userId} segment of the path is the primary source of 
     *    truth for authorization. Users can only access paths where {userId} matches their UID.
     * 2. Strict Privacy: There are no public collections. All data is private to the owner.
     * 3. Relational Consistency: During creation, we verify that the document's internal 
     *    'id' field matches the Firestore document ID to ensure data integrity.
     * 4. Prototyping Flexibility: While authorization is strictly enforced (who can write), 
     *    the schema itself (what is written) remains flexible to allow for rapid iteration.
     * 
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     * This model avoids 'get()' calls by nesting demands directly under the user who owns them.
